# Cryptography Labs
This repository contains the source code for the labs in my Cryptography class, implemented in C++. The labs cover a range of topics related to cryptography, including encryption, decryption, and hash functions.

## Requirements
In order to run the code in this repository, you will need:

- C++ compiler (such as g++)
- The OpenSSL library
## Labs
The labs in this repository are organized by topic:

- Lab 1: Caesar Cipher
- Lab 2: Vigen√®re Cipher
- Lab 3: Block Ciphers
- Lab 4: RSA Encryption and Decryption
- Lab 5: Hash Functions

Each lab is contained within its own directory, and includes a README file with more detailed instructions on how to run the code.

## Getting Started
To get started with the labs, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/tuanle03/Cryptography_Lab.git```

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the directory for the lab you wish to work on and follow the instructions in the README file.

## Contributing
If you find any issues with the code in this repository or would like to contribute improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
